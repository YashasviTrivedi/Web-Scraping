# Web-Scraping
Certainly, let's condense the information into three paragraphs:

The Python code presented is a web scraping and data analysis tool designed to extract and evaluate customer reviews for British Airways from "airlinequality.com." The code initiates the process by importing essential Python libraries, including `requests`, `numpy`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas`, which are used for web scraping, data manipulation, and analysis.

The core of the code revolves around data collection, where it systematically collects reviews, star ratings, dates, and the reviewers' countries of origin from multiple pages on the website. It accumulates this data in corresponding lists. To ensure data consistency, the code limits the dataset to 3418 records and structures it within a Pandas DataFrame. Furthermore, it performs text preprocessing to refine the review text, including eliminating non-alphabetic characters, converting text to lowercase, and lemmatizing words, resulting in a 'corpus' column for analysis.

The code conducts thorough data analysis, including statistical insights into the distribution of ratings, the count of reviews per rating, and average ratings by reviewers' countries. It also creates a timeline of ratings over time. The code wraps up by generating a visually compelling word cloud that highlights the most frequent terms in the reviews, offering a quick overview of recurring themes in the feedback. In summary, this Python code serves as a comprehensive tool to collect, clean, and analyze British Airways customer reviews, providing valuable insights into customer satisfaction and feedback trends.
